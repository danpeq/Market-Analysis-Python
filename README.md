# Market-Analysis-Python
I've decided to open a small robot-run caf√© in Los Angeles. I'm an analytics specialist so I've been asked to prepare a market study. We have open source data on restaurants in LA.

My business colleagues are trying to attract investors and are interested in current market conditions.

What I do in this project:
1. Data analysis:
   
a. Research the proportions of different types of establishments.

b. Research the proportions of establishments that belong to a chain and those that do not. Draw a graph.

c. What type of establishment is typically a chain?

d. Determine the average number of seats for each type of restaurant. On average, which type of restaurant has the most seats?

d. Draw a graph of the top ten streets by number of restaurants.

e. Find the number of streets that only have one restaurant.

f. For streets with many restaurants, analyze the distribution of the number of seats. What trends can you see?

And I prepare a presentation at the end with the conclusions.
